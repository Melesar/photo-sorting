# How to sort 400 wedding photos using the command line

This is the demo project for my blog post: https://pikhota.com/posts/photo-sorting

To successfully run these scripts you need to install dependencies:

1) [Feh](https://feh.finalrewind.org/) - minimal image viewer for command line
2) [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) - a window switcher, application launcher and dmenu replacement
3) [Fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - a command line fuzzy finder
